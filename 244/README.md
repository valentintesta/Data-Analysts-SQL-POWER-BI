## Features

1. **Customer Engagement:**
   - Identify customers who haven't made transactions in the last year.
   - Suggest strategies to make them active again based on regional data.

2. **Transaction Analysis:**
   - Summarize total transaction amounts per account per month.
   - Calculate daily transaction volumes for the past month.

3. **Branch Performance:**
   - Rank branches by total deposits made in the last quarter.
   - Identify the branch with the highest average account balance.

4. **Fraud Detection:**
   - Detect accounts with more than two transactions in a single day.
   - Propose methods to verify potential fraudulent activity.

5. **Demographic Insights:**
   - Analyze total transaction amounts across age groups (0-17, 18-30, 31-60, 60+).

6. **Activity and Balance Trends:**
   - Calculate the average number of transactions per customer per account per month over the last year.
   - Compute average balances per customer at the end of each month in the last year.
